## About

* Includes basic tools like hex and rebar
* Optimized for size: the image is about 366MB (~345MB of that is OS and Erlang).
* Sets up an unpriviliged user
* It's built using a Raspberry Pi 2. Please open an issue if it does not work on your Raspberry Pi version.
* Built on [rpi-erlang](https://github.com/joakimk/rpi-erlang).
* Can also be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/joakimk/rpi-elixir/).

## Installing and running

On a Raspberry Pi running [an OS with docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/):

    # This takes about 7 minutes on a fast connection, less for updates later as
    # you will have the OS and erlang images already.
    docker pull joakimk/rpi-elixir

    # or: docker pull joakimk/rpi-elixir:1.1.1

    docker run -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir iex

Example of mounting a project:

    $ echo "IO.puts('Hello')" > hello.exs
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/project -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir bash
    deploy@33db28b1e140:~$ cd /project
    deploy@33db28b1e140:/project$ elixir hello.exs
    Hello

Example of running tests in a mix project:

    $ cd path/to/project
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/project -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir bash
    deploy@33db28b1e140:~$ cd /project
    deploy@33db28b1e140:/project$ mix deps.get
    deploy@33db28b1e140:/project$ mix test
