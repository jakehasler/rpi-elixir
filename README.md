## About

* Sets up an unpriviliged user
* Includes basic tools like hex and rebar (so you can just run "mix deps.get && mix test" in a regular mix project).
* Optimized for size: the image is about ? (~345MB of that is OS and Erlang).
* It's built using a Raspberry Pi 2. Please open an issue if it does not work on your Raspberry Pi version.
* Built on [rpi-erlang](https://github.com/joakimk/rpi-erlang).
* Can also be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/joakimk/rpi-elixir/).

## Installing and running

On a Raspberry Pi running [an OS with docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/):

    # This takes about 7 minutes on a fast connection, less for updates later as
    # you will have the OS and erlang images already.
    docker pull joakimk/rpi-elixir

    # or: docker pull joakimk/rpi-elixir:1.1.1

    docker run -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir iex

Example of mounting a project:

    $ echo "IO.puts('Hello')" > hello.exs
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/project -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir bash
    root@c0091ee9dfee:/# cd /project/
    root@c0091ee9dfee:/project# elixir hello.exs
    Hello
    
Also see the example of running a phoenix app: <https://github.com/joakimk/rpi-elixir-phoenix-app-example>
