An Elixir docker image for Raspberry Pi.

Just put [an OS with docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/) on it's memory card and run `docker run -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir` to get:

## About

* Includes basic tools like hex and rebar
* Optimized for size: the image is about 366MB (~345MB of that is OS and Erlang).
* Secure by default (by using a unpriviliged user, which can be overriden in [your own Dockerfile](#adding-more-software-or-overriding-settings-locally)).
* It's built using a Raspberry Pi 2.
  - Please open an issue if it does not work on your Raspberry Pi version.
* Built on [rpi-erlang](https://github.com/joakimk/rpi-erlang).
* Can also be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/joakimk/rpi-elixir/).
* Downloading takes about 7 minutes on a fast connection, less for updates.

## Installing

On a Raspberry Pi running [an OS with docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/):

    docker pull joakimk/rpi-elixir
    
Or get a specific tag:
    
    docker pull joakimk/rpi-elixir:1.1.1
    
All available tags can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/joakimk/rpi-elixir/tags/).

## Running

Running an iex prompt:

    docker run -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir
    # or: docker run -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir:1.1.1

Example of running a mix/phoenix project without building a new image:

    $ cd path/to/project
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/project -i -t -p 4000:4000 joakimk/rpi-elixir bash
    deploy@33db28b1e140:~$ cd /project
    deploy@33db28b1e140:/project$ mix deps.get
    deploy@33db28b1e140:/project$ mix test
    deploy@33db28b1e140:/project$ mix phoenix.server

You can also try the phoenix chat app example: [rpi-elixir-phoenix-app-example](https://github.com/joakimk/rpi-elixir-phoenix-app-example).

## Adding more software or overriding settings locally

Add a "Dockerfile":

    FROM joakimk/rpi-elixir
    USER root
    RUN apt-get update \
      && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends vim \
      && apt-get clean \
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    USER deploy
    CMD ["bash"]
    
Then build your own image:
    
    $ docker build -t elixir-dev .
    
And use it:
  
    $ docker run -i -t -p 4000:4000 elixir-dev
    deploy@33db28b1e140:~$ $ vim --version|head -1
    VIM - Vi IMproved 7.3 (2010 Aug 15, compiled Feb 20 2013 06:48:10)
