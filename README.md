About:

* Optimized for size: the image is about 349MB (~345MB of that is OS and Erlang)
* It's built using a Raspberry Pi 2. Please open an issue if it does not work on your Raspberry Pi version.

## Installing and running

On a Raspberry Pi running [an OS with docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/):

    # This takes about 7 minutes on a fast connection, less for updates later as
    # you will have the OS and erlang images already.
    docker pull joakimk/rpi-elixir:1.1.1

    docker run -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir:1.1.1 iex
    
Example of mounting a project:

    $ echo "IO.puts('Hello')" > hello.exs
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/project -i -t joakimk/rpi-elixir:1.1.1 bash
    root@c0091ee9dfee:/# cd /project/
    root@c0091ee9dfee:/project# elixir hello.exs
    Hello
    
More on this, and not running as root, soon :)
